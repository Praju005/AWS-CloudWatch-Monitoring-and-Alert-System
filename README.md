![AWS CloudWatch Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Praju005/AWS-CloudWatch-Monitoring-and-Alert-System/main/assets/cloudwatch-architecture.png)

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **real-time EC2 instance monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch**, integrated with **SNS notifications** for instant alerts.  
Where engineers proactively monitor server performance and receive automated alerts when CPU usage exceeds a set threshold.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
> Automatically monitor CPU utilization of an EC2 instance and send an SMS/Email alert when CPU usage exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 70%).

---

## 🧩 AWS Services Used  

| Service | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Amazon EC2** | Hosts the virtual server workload |
| **Amazon CloudWatch** | Monitors and visualizes performance metrics like CPU usage |
| **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)** | Sends alerts via SMS or Email when alarm thresholds are breached |

⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation
1️⃣ Launch an EC2 Instance
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance

Select Amazon Linux 2 AMI

Choose t2.micro (Free Tier)

Name: CloudWatchDemoInstance

2️⃣ Create an SNS Topic
Go to SNS → Topics → Create topic

Name it: HighCPUAlerts

Create a subscription (SMS or Email)

Confirm your subscription (check your inbox or phone)

3️⃣ Create a CloudWatch Alarm
Go to CloudWatch → Alarms → Create alarm

Choose metric: EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics → CPUUtilization

Set condition: Threshold ≥ 70%

Period: 1 minute

Action: Send notification to → HighCPUAlerts

Name the alarm: High_CPU_Alarm

4️⃣ Test the Alarm
Connect to EC2 using EC2 Instance Connect or SSH, then run:

bash
Copy code
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &
This command simulates high CPU usage.
Wait 2–3 minutes — your CloudWatch alarm will turn In Alarm, and you’ll receive a notification (SMS or Email).

5️⃣ Stop the Load
To stop the CPU load:

bash
Copy code
killall dd
The alarm will return to OK status when CPU usage drops.

📊 Output
✅ CloudWatch Alarm triggered when CPU > 70%
📩 SNS SMS/Email notification received
📈 CloudWatch dashboard displayed CPU metrics
